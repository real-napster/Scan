## Building

Signing uses the team set in `Config/Shared.xcconfig`. To build with your own
Apple Developer team, copy `Config/Local.xcconfig.example` to
`Config/Local.xcconfig` (ignored by git) and set `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` there.
Leave the team in Xcode's Signing & Capabilities pane untouched: choosing one
there writes it into the project file, which overrides the configuration files.

## Shortcuts and automation

Scan publishes three App Intents to Shortcuts and Siri: **Scan Document**,
**Refresh Scanners**, and **Open Scan**. The scan action lets a shortcut choose
from the profiles saved in Scan, always exports the captured pages, and returns
the resulting files to the next shortcut action. Its destination is the folder
selected in Scan, so select that folder once in the app before automating scans.

The same actions are also available from the app's **Scan** menu: Scan Document
(Command-Return), Quick Look Selected Page (Command-Y), Export Pages
(Command-Shift-E), and Refresh Scanners (Command-Shift-R).

## Hardware button / one-touch scanning

Supported scanners use the physical Scan button by default; turn off **Use
physical Scan button** in Settings to opt out. The setting persists and
supports a global profile, per-scanner profile and destination overrides,
optional launch at login, reconnect retry, and completion/failure
notifications. Native Fujitsu button polling is validated on the S1500, S510M,
iX500, and iX1600; other Fujitsu profiles are explicitly marked unvalidated.
The S1300i's button and one-touch scanning are validated on hardware.
The S300 reports its physical button experimentally, but one-touch acquisition
remains unavailable while its image protocol is still incomplete. Image Capture
button delivery depends on macOS assigning Scan as the scanner's button target.

## Reviewing pages

The page grid behaves like the Finder's icon view. Click a page to select it
and give the grid keyboard focus (Tab also reaches it when keyboard navigation
is enabled in System Settings); the arrow keys, Home and End then move the
selection, Space opens the selected page in Quick Look, and a click on empty
space clears the selection. The slider next to "Reveal in Finder" sets the
thumbnail size.

## Automatic alignment

ScanSnap Home straightens sheets and crops away their edges in software; the
scanners themselves only trim the page length (the iX-series reports no
hardware deskew or crop in its capability page). Scan does the same with the
**Deskew and crop to page** option in the Processing section of a profile,
applied to every page on export, and with **Edit > Auto-Align Page**
(Command-Shift-L, also in a page's context menu) for a selected page. The
separate **Crop to content** option trims the paper margins down to the
printed content afterwards, for receipts and clippings. The page outline is found
with Vision's document segmentation, the sheet is rotated by the tilt of its
edges onto a white canvas, and the result is cropped to the largest rectangle
inside the straightened sheet, minus a small margin that removes the edge
shadow. When no outline can be found, the tilt is estimated from the content
(the angle at which the rows of dark pixels line up best) and the background
wedges left by the rotation are cropped away.

## Reviewing and processing pages

Scanning produces an intermediate result that you refine before exporting.
The app keeps every raw scan for the review session and shows processed
renditions in the page grid: the profile's processing options (deskew and
crop, crop to content, whiten paper, paper cleanup, automatic orientation,
blank-page removal) are applied to each page as it arrives, in the
background, and re-applied to all pages whenever an option changes. Blank
pages are hidden rather than deleted and reappear when blank-page removal is
switched off; the header shows how many are hidden. Rotate and Auto-Align
from the Edit menu are per-page adjustments layered on top of the profile.
Export writes exactly the pages you see, applying only the output
resolution and compression. The session ends with Clear or the next scan.

## Paper tone and blank pages

The iX-series delivers plain paper as light gray (about 230–245 of 255 on
the iX1600 depending on the paper, with the scanner's built-in gamma curve
about ten levels lighter than a downloaded linear table). **Whiten paper**
in the Processing section measures each page's paper level and stretches it
to white while black stays black; pages whose overall tone is not paper, such
as photos, are left alone. Blank-page removal judges ink relative to the same
paper level (with the sheet's edge excluded), so a blank page is recognised
whatever gray the scanner makes of it, and a dark page is never treated as
blank.

Most profiles target legacy models that Ricoh no longer supports on current
macOS: ScanSnap Home dropped the iX500 with macOS 15, and its fi Series macOS
driver covers only fi-7000 and fi-8000 models. The iX1300, iX1400, iX1500 and
iX1600 are the exception: they are also claimed here to provide the app's
direct native USB path. The
fi-5000/fi-6000 and fi-5110EOX profiles reuse the S1500 command flow with the
model notes from SANE's `fujitsu` backend:
colour interlacing is probed, the optional mode selects and the gamma table are
best effort, and native line-art widths are rounded to whole bytes. The iX100
and the fi-7000/fi-8000 models are still supported by Ricoh and are not claimed.

The iX500 uses model-specific pre-read and JPEG-table setup,
always scans in color (gray and line-art are derived in the app), and offers
two optional acquisition settings: scanner buffering (the iX500 reads the next
sheet into its own memory while the previous one is transferred) and hardware
JPEG compression (about 2 MB instead of 27 MB per A4 color page over USB).
Other Image Capture-compatible scanners continue to work through macOS’s
Image Capture backend.

### ScanSnap iX1600, iX1500, iX1400 and iX1300

The iX1600 is recognized over USB as `0x04c5/0x1632`, the iX1500 as
`0x04c5/0x159f`, the iX1400 as `0x04c5/0x1630` and the iX1300 as
`0x04c5/0x162c`. All four use the generic Fujitsu SCSI-over-USB command flow
documented by SANE (no iX500-style pre-read or JPEG quantisation table) with
the hopper check before the first feed, the scanner's built-in gamma curve
instead of a downloaded table (SANE's choice for this generation; the
built-in curve renders mid-tones noticeably lighter), and SANE's way of closing
a batch (a scanner-control cancel once the feeder is empty; the iX1600's
firmware locked up with "unexpected error" on its display when a batch ended
without it). The profile supports ADF front, back, and duplex acquisition at
150, 200, 300, 400, and 600 dpi, asks the scanner for native color, gray, or
line-art data, reads in 256 KiB chunks, and offers the same optional scanner
buffering and hardware JPEG compression as the iX500. In hardware JPEG mode the
iX1600 writes the full window height into the JPEG header and ends the data
after the last real row; the app restores the true height from the restart
markers.

The iX1600 (firmware 0V00) was validated on hardware: duplex color batches at
300 dpi with automatic length detection, native gray and line-art, 400 and
600 dpi windows, hardware JPEG, scanner buffering, 256 KiB reads, the vital
product data page, the hopper check, and the empty-feeder path. The iX1500,
iX1400 and iX1300 share the iX1600 profile because they share its generation
and command flow (SANE drives all of them with the same generic flow and
lists the iX1300 as working), but none of them has been tested with this
profile on its own hardware yet. The iX1300's straight return path is not
supported, only its regular feeder. Wi-Fi scanning and touchscreen-triggered
scans are not supported. The
opt-in harness in `ScanTests/FujitsuScanSnapHardwareTests.swift` captures
pages, a command trace, and the VPD page, and can try profile variations on a
new scanner without rebuilding.

Note: ScanSnap Home keeps the scanner's USB interface open exclusively while
its background process (`SshResident`) runs. Quit ScanSnap Home before using
this app with the same scanner.

Hardware validation runs are opt-in: see `ScanTests/FujitsuScanSnapHardwareTests.swift`.

The S300/S300M/S1300/S1300i are one direct bulk-USB family handled by the
experimental epjitsu backend. This protocol is separate from the Fujitsu
SCSI-over-USB backend used by the iX-series and older S1500-family drivers;
the S1300i must not be routed through that backend. The epjitsu driver
implements firmware-status, user-supplied firmware upload/checksum,
reinitialization, identity, and the common hardware-status exchange. Firmware
is model-specific (`300_0C00.nal`, `300M_0C00.nal`, `1300_0C26.nal`, or
`1300i_0D12.nal`), copyrighted, and never bundled; select it under Diagnostics.
For the S300, S300M and S1300, calibrated image acquisition is not enabled
yet and S1300 button interpretation is unvalidated, so these are preliminary
rather than production scan support. S1100/S1100i are not claimed.

The S1300i has its own acquisition flow (`EpjitsuS1300iAcquisition.swift`):
it detects AC or USB bus power, runs the coarse and fine calibration, replays
the fixed SET WINDOW payloads and calibration headers for its power source and
resolution, and reads each sheet block by block, ending it at the length the
scanner reports. It is validated on AC power; USB bus power uses the matching
tables but is untested. Its USB session needs special handling, enabled for
the S1300i only: the transport does not clear the bulk endpoints' halt state
(the scanner does not reset its data toggle and stops responding until it is
power-cycled), selects a configuration when the scanner comes up unconfigured
after power-on, and keeps a process-wide libusb context; the hardware-button
monitor hands the scanner over only after the previous session has closed.

The protocol work is based on the public [SANE epjitsu backend](https://gitlab.com/sane-project/backends/-/tree/master/backend)
and its [device documentation](https://www.sane-project.org/man/sane-epjitsu.5.html),
without incorporating the GPL implementation into this MIT-licensed project.
The fixed S1300i command payloads in `Scan/EpjitsuUSB/EpjitsuProtocolTables.swift`
are the USB protocol values SANE records in `epjitsu-cmd.h` from traces of
the vendor driver.
